# Chatbot
Chatbot for HealthCare App

Uses ML from python to search a list on queries from the intents.json file.
The Fully connected network groups the questions the user asks to groups that fit into a specific type of question that is given in the intents.json file. It then returns an appropriate response from that category which is pre-written into the JSON file.
